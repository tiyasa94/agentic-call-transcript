Offer concrete solutions like upgrading their plan to one with better coverage, providing a detailed breakdown of charges to avoid hidden fees, and ensuring that customer service interactions are friendly, helpful, and empowered to resolve issues efficiently. Given the customer's loyalty and spending habits, recognize their value and express appreciation for their business. In real-time, agents should be guided to empathize with the customer's frustration, validate their concerns, and work proactively to address the root causes of dissatisfaction. This may involve escalating issues promptly, providing transparent information, and following up to ensure that problems are fully resolved.
